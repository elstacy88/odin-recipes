                <li>1 lb. Chicken</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped finely</li>
                <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1 qt heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>fresh or dried basil</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
                <li>parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat in sauce pan. Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces and add to pan. Cook entirely and set aside in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, boil a pot of water and add fettucini noodles to cool about 8-10 minutes until al dente.</li>
                <li>In same pan, add more olive oil if needed. Add onion and cook until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and stir for 1 minute, careful not to burn.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in pan and lower heat.</li>
                <li>Add broccoli or cooked bacon at this point, or other vegetables, if desired.</li>
                <li>Add heavy cream and stir occasionally, bringing to a slow boil for about 5 minutes. It will get bubble and thicken into a sauce consistency.</li>
                <li>Add fresh or dried basil, mixed italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and other seasonings to taste.</li>
                <li>Add about 2 cups of grated parmesan cheese, spring for the more expensive kind it is worth it but any type will do.</li>
                <li>Mix until completely melted and sauce is thickened.</li>
                <li>Add al dente fettucini noodles to pan with a couple cups of pasta water and cover with lid.</li>
                <li>Simmer about 5 minutes to cook pasta the rest of the way, and voila!</li>
                <li>Top with more parmesan cheese, and serve with toasted garlic bread.</li>
            </ol>
